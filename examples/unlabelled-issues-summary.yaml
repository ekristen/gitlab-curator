              Hi Triage Team,

              Here is a list of the latest issues without labels in the project.

              {{ range .Issues }}
              - [ ] {{ .References.Full }} {{ .Title }}
              {{- end }}

              For the issues triaged please check off the box in front of the given issue.

              Once you've triaged all the issues assigned to you, you can unassign yourself with the `/unassign me` quick action.

              **When all the checkboxes are done, close the issue, and celebrate!** :tada:

              /assign @hi
              /label ~"kind/triage"
