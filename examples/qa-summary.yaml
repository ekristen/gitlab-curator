              Hi @qa,

              Here are the issues that are closed that require QA and that are NOT yet verified.

              For the issues listed please review and verify, then check off each issue and add `verified/qa` to each issue once verified.

              **Important:** If there is a problem with one of the close issues, **OPEN** a new issue on the same project, then use the `/copy_metadata #OLD_ISSUE_NUMBER` to copy milestones, labels over to the new issue. Also reference the old issue and relate it.

              {{ range .Issues }}
              - [ ] {{ .References.Full }} {{ .Title }} - {{ range .Labels }}~"{{.}}" {{ end }}
              {{- end }}

              /assign @hi
              /label ~"kind/triage"
