            Hi @{{ .Issue.Author.Username }},

            Epics should not used fixed dates. If a placeholder issue does not exist, please create and assign to the quarterly
            milestone in which you'd expect this epic to be started and/or completed in.

            Please refer to URL for more guidance.

            Thanks!
